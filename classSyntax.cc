// Why do we give semicolons at the end of class?
/*
Many people might say that itâ€™s a basic syntax and we should give a semicolon at the end of the class as its rule defines in cpp. 
But the main reason why semi-colons are there at the end of the class is compiler checks if the user is trying to create an instance of the class at the end of it. 
Yes just like structure and union, we can also create the instance of a class at the end just before the semicolon. 
As a result, once execution reaches at that line, it creates a class and allocates memory to your instance.
